## Inspiration:
Medtronic's Cybersecurity Workshop taught how dangerous vulnerable software can be which inspired us to tackle the issue of password security for the average person as well as medical professionals and other positions of high importance. For our project, we wanted to create an application that not only helps people develop more secure passwords to protect sensitive data and their livelihoods but also educates them on specific issues and provides specialized suggestions for their individual situations.

## What it does:
(Title here) brings forward a simple-to-use educational password strength application to be put in the hands of many. Users may input a prospective password into the textbox. After which, a variety of metrics will be run on the password, and then each metric score is analyzed and aggregated to form an overall score. After research and testing, we decided that calculating Shanon Entropy, Password Entropy, and sequence alignment to common passwords, as well as using Huffman Encoding, would be the optimal metrics for scoring. Additional information on each metric and their respective scores will be displayed for the user to learn more if they wish to learn more. This way, the general password strength can be measured by the overarching score while still being able to provide personalized suggestions for each individual password instead of general tips.

## How we built it:
Figma prototype -> Application interface. Researched and implemented metrics.
